# The XeroDiff Balance Mod

Another rebalance for the original HoMM3 creatures.

Aims at decreasing CE differences between creatures of the same level from different towns via adjusting their attributes (and also make their recruiting costs same)

The less difference the better.

Current Settings:

- Inferno: Offensive
- Dungeon: Not decided yet
- Necropolis: Death (Health absorbing, etc)
- Castle: Balanced
- Tower: Not decided yet
- Stronghold: Mighty
- Rampart: Defensive
- Fortress: Not decided yet
- Conflux: Magic

STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGE!
